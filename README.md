# Populate Burp

This script is designed to populate Burpsuite from a list of URLs, checking several HTTP Verbs for a list of endpoints.  

Failing to consider checking for different HTTP Verbs when conducting Enumeration is a common mistake for Bug Bounty Hunters

Usage: `go run main.go urls.txt endpoints.txt` (I'll do it right eventually...)
